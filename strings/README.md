#### "Check Permutation"

A Permutation of a string is another string that contains same characters, only the order of characters can be different. For example, “abcd” and “dabc” are Permutation of each other.

Given two strings s1 and s2, write a function to return true if s2 contains the permutation of s1. In other words, one of the first string's permutations is the substring of the second string.

Food for thought:
Strings of different lengths can't be perms!
Case sensitive? White spaces?
Size of character set.
What's the definition of permutation?
Sorting?
Hash table?
